Create and stick notes to any page on any position

== Description ==
= With this plugin you are able to: = 

*   Create and stick note to any page on any position
*   Tag users on a note with “@” and target note to specified users
*   Communicate between website administrator and developer by simple notes ( tasks )
*   See exact location of problem or some issue
*   Control issues and communicate by inline note editing

This plugin uses as less scripts and css as possible to avoid traffic load or performance problem, and is as simple as possible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Created note is not draggable. Why? =
This plugin uses jQuery library and jQuery UI. In some situations there are multiple jQuery libraries included in document footer and head. In most cases this problem appears when there is jQuery included after jQuery UI. Check if there is jQuery included after jQuery UI.

= Note is not in exact location where I sticked it. =
This happens when website is with responsive design and  you are viewing notes in non desktop version. This plugin is optimized on desktop resolutions.
